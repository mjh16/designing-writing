Hey all, to help streamline the process of submitting materials for me to upload, here are a few guideline that will be helpful. First, please format your pieces as Plain Text. You can do this out of Word by doing a save as, plain text. This will help to strip any formatting.

First, providing some metadata will be useful. At the top of each of your pages I am going to ask that you enter some metadata in the TOML format, which looks like this:

{{< highlight TOML >}}
