If you'd like to install Hugo and work with it on your own, and contribute to the webtext in that way, here are the links to the different tools and repositories that I am using:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mjh16/designing-writing)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

I will gladly work with anyone on working through how to use the tools.
